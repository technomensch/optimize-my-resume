**Version:** 9.3.7
**Enforcement Level:** Structural (Layer 1-4)
**Target Compliance:** 60-80% (Probabilistic)

## 1. Project Setup

Upload exactly these files to your Claude Project Knowledge:

1. **The Entrypoint:** `Project-GUI-Instructions.md` (v9.3.7)
2. **The Logic Hub:** `optimization-tools/bullet-optimizer/bo_bullet-generation-instructions.md` (v9.3.7)
3. **The Gold Master:** `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (v9.3.7)
4. **Validation Schema:** `docs/workflow-templates/guardrail-validation-schema.md`
5. **Workflow Template:** `docs/workflow-templates/constrained-generation-workflow.md`
6. **Your Resume:** `[Filename].pdf` or `.txt`

## 2. Multi-Turn Generation (MANDATORY)

Do NOT run bullet generation in a single turn. It will fail. Use this sequence:

### Turn 1: Planning
**Prompt:** "Reference `constrained-generation-workflow.md` Turn 1. Review my job history and JD. Generate the Unified Planning Table and Keyword Distribution Plan. STOP before generating any bullets."

**Verification:** Confirm the word count total is < 500 and positions are in reverse chronological order.

### Turn 2: Execution
**Prompt:** "Approved. Execute Turn 2. Generate bullets following the `guardrail-validation-schema.md` JSON format. Inject all Layer 4 guardrails literally. Conclude with the Final Reconciliation Table."

---

## 3. Realistic Expectations

- **Compliance Ceiling:** Research shows prompt-based guardrails achieve ~60% compliance.
- **Fail-Open Policy:** If Claude violates a rule (e.g., word count), paste the output into `scripts/validate_bullets.py` locally and ask Claude to fix the specific errors.
- **Visible Proof:** If the "Proof of Work" JSON is missing, the output is invalid. Reject it immediately.
