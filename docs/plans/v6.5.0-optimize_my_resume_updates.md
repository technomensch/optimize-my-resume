<bullet_metrics_detection_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 - All bullet displays</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Visually indicate whether each bullet contains quantified metrics.
    Helps users identify which bullets have impact evidence and which need strengthening.
  </purpose>

  <metric_types_recognized>
    <type pattern="\d+%">Percentages (e.g., "50%", "3.2%")</type>
    <type pattern="\$\d+">Currency (e.g., "$2M", "$500K", "$1.2B")</type>

    <type pattern="(Top|First) \d+">Rankings (e.g., "Top 10", "First 5")</type>
  </metric_types_recognized>

  <detection_algorithm>
    1. Scan each bullet for any metric pattern above
    2. If ANY metric found: Mark bullet as "HAS METRICS" ✓
    3. If NO metrics found: Mark bullet as "NO METRICS" -
  </detection_algorithm>

  <display_format>
    When displaying bullets, add a metric indicator next to each bullet:
    
    ✓ (Green checkmark) = Bullet contains quantified metric(s)
    - (Gray dash) = Bullet lacks quantified metrics
  </display_format>

  <reporting_in_phase_1>
    In Phase 1 Resume Analysis Report, include summary per position:

     Target: 70-80% of bullets should contain metrics"

## UPDATE 4: HIRING MANAGER PERSPECTIVE ANALYSIS

<hiring_manager_perspective_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis only</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Analyze resume as an external hiring manager or recruiter would.
    Ignore resume job titles and infer actual job title/role based on:
    - Core responsibilities and deliverables
    - Skills demonstrated through achievements
    - Industry context and company type
    - Seniority level implied by scope and impact
    - Career progression patterns
  </purpose>

  <analysis_methodology>
    <step number="1" name="context_gathering">
      For each position in the resume:
      - Read all bullets (both responsibilities and achievements)
      - Note the company type and industry
      - Identify scope (team size, budget, customer base, etc.)
      - Assess seniority level
      - Track patterns across positions
    </step>

    <step number="2" name="title_interpretation">
      Infer what the job title likely was, based on actual work.
      Use actual market job titles, not internal or creative titles.
      
      Examples of inference logic:
      - If bullets show: "Managed team", "Set roadmap", "Owned product decisions"
        → Likely: Product Manager, Product Owner
      - If bullets show: "Built systems", "Architected solutions"
        → Likely: Software Engineer, Technical Lead, Engineering Manager
      - If bullets show: "Wrote documentation", "Created user guides"
        → Likely: Technical Writer, Documentation Specialist
    </step>

    <step number="3" name="seniority_assessment">
      Determine seniority level based on:
      - Team leadership (0 = Individual contributor, 3+ = Team lead, 10+ = Manager+)
      - Budget responsibility ($0 = None, $100K+ = Budget owner, $1M+ = Executive)
      - Strategic vs. tactical work (Strategic = Senior, Tactical = Junior)
      - Cross-functional scope (Wide = Senior, Narrow = Junior)
      
      Adjust title with seniority level:
      - Junior/Entry: "Software Engineer", "Junior Developer"
      - Mid-level: "Senior Software Engineer", "Lead Developer"
      - Senior: "Principal Engineer", "Engineering Manager"
    </step>

    <step number="4" name="maintain_position_order">
      Keep positions in chronological order as they appear in resume.
      Do NOT re-order or reorganize positions.
    </step>

    <step number="5" name="reasoning_documentation">
      For each inferred title, document:
      - Which bullets led to this interpretation
      - What specific skills/achievements implied the role
      - How this differs from the stated title (if different)
      - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

    To conserve tokens and avoid redundancy, audit display must be SURGICALLY 
    INTEGRATED with existing bullet output. Bullet text itself is NOT duplicated. 
    Audit table appears directly after the original bullet point.
  </integration_rule>

  <analysis_table_structure>
    <description>
      A three-row table displayed directly under each bullet point. 
      Each row corresponds to a specific quality check.
    </description>
    
    <row id="1" name="Metrics">
      <column_1>Metrics</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If metrics are detected (per v6.5.1 rules).
        - "Failed": If no metrics are detected.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": List the metrics found (e.g., "65% reduction, 2.5M transactions").
        - On "Failed": Provide a suggestion (e.g., "Add: # of documents, team members trained...").
      </column_3>
    </row>
    
    <row id="2" name="Action Verb">
      <column_1>Action Verb</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If verb is strong and not redundant.
        - "Weak": If verb is passive (e.g., "Worked on").
        - "Redundant": If the same verb category is used in a nearby bullet.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": Show the verb category and the verb itself (e.g., "🔵 Built: Architected").
        - On "Weak": Explain why it's weak and suggest alternatives.
        - On "Redundant": Note the redundancy and suggest alternatives.
      </column_3>
    </row>
    
    <row id="3" name="Char Count">
      <column_1>Char Count</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If character count is within the target range (100-210).
        - "Failed": If character count is too short or too long.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": Show the count (e.g., "178/210").
        - On "Failed": Show the count and how far it is from the minimum/maximum.
      </column_3>
