**Branch:** `v9.0.2-narrative-verification`
**Target Release:** v9.0.2
**Type:** Patch (Feature Enhancement)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Pending

---

## Issues Included

- **Issue #64** - Post-Analysis Narrative Fit Verification

---

## Overview

Add post-analysis narrative fit verification to ensure the job history narrative quality doesn't negatively impact the fit assessment.

---

## Context

After fit analysis completes, verify that the narrative itself (if job history was used) meets quality standards and hasn't caused the analysis to miss key qualifications.

---

## Implementation Approach

### Key Questions to Address:
1. Was the narrative sufficiently detailed?
2. Did important qualifications get missed due to poor narrative structure?
3. Should the user improve their job history and re-run?

### Proposed Solution:
- Add verification section after analysis results
- Check narrative quality indicators:
  - Presence of metrics/impact statements
  - Skill demonstration clarity
  - Achievement documentation
- Suggest narrative improvements if quality is low

### No Additional API Calls Required
This can be done through analysis of existing data structures.

## Verification Steps

1. Run analysis with high-quality job history - verify no warnings
2. Run analysis with low-quality narrative - verify suggestions appear
3. Check that verification doesn't add significant processing time
4. Ensure suggestions are actionable and helpful
5. Test with resume input (not job history) - verify appropriate handling
