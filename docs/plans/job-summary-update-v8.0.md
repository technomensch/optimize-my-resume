### IV. Formatting & Guidance Update (Footer)

Action: Update role adaptation and formatting rules.

<role_adaptation>
  - For BA/PO roles: Emphasize requirements traceability, backlog readiness, stakeholder orchestration, and process optimization.
  - For TW roles: Emphasize documentation as a product, leveraging BA requirements (User Stories, Acceptance Criteria) to drive technical accuracy, and creating self-service knowledge architectures that reduce support overhead.
  - Bridging BA/PO to TW: Highlight how technical requirements and system architectures (BA work) provide the 'source of truth' for high-fidelity technical documentation, ensuring 100% alignment between system capabilities and user guidance.
