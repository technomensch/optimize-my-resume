# Implementation Plan: v9.3.0-ENH-002-knowledge-foundation

**Title:** Bullet Generation: Process & Knowledge Foundation
**Issue:** ENH-002
**Version:** 9.3.0
**Branch:** `v9.3.0-ENH-002-knowledge-foundation`

## Problem Statement
The current bullet generation process intermittently fails to follow the logic modules (like `bo_bullet-generation-logic.md`) because there is no explicit agent workflow command to route and enforce these rules. Additionally, lessons learned from complex personal projects (Position 0) are not yet codified, leading to suboptimal metric use (e.g., "lines of code" vs "guardrails").

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Workflow Optimization
- **[MODIFY] [.claude/skills/lesson-learned.md](.claude/skills/lesson-learned.md)**
  - Add explicit instructions to update the Knowledge Graph (`docs/knowledge/*.md`) as a final step in the lesson creation/update process.
  - This ensures persistence of the lesson's impact on project architecture.

### 2. Knowledge Capture: Lessons Learned
- **[NEW] [docs/lessons-learned/process/LL_Personal_Project_Metrics.md](docs/lessons-learned/process/LL_Personal_Project_Metrics.md)**
  - Document the transition from "Lines of Code" metrics to "Efficiency/Guardrail/Knowledge Graph" metrics for personal portfolio projects.
  - Detail the reasoning for avoiding management verbs (e.g., "Directed") in solo initiatives.

### 3. Architecture Definition: ADR
- **[NEW] [docs/knowledge/adr/ADR-005-Hub-and-Spoke-Bullet-Generation.md](docs/knowledge/adr/ADR-005-Hub-and-Spoke-Bullet-Generation.md)**
  - Define the "Hub-and-Spoke" model where a central logic hub (`bo_bullet-generation-instructions.md`) is invoked by both local and web GUI components via a unified workflow router.

### 4. Knowledge Graph Update
- **[MODIFY] [docs/knowledge/patterns.md](docs/knowledge/patterns.md)**
  - Add the "Hub-and-Spoke Workflow Delegation" pattern.

## Verification Plan
1. **Workflow Verification:** Trigger `/lessons-learned update` and verify it prompts for KG updates.
2. **File Verification:** Ensure all new files follow the project's XML/Markdown schema.
3. **Traceability:** Verify ADR-005 is correctly linked in the Knowledge Graph master index.
