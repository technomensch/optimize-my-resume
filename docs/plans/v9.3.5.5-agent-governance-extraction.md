# Implementation Plan: v9.3.5.5-agent-governance-extraction

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE
**GOVERNANCE:** Atomic Approval Required
**SCOPE:** Token Optimization (Extraction of Dev-Only Agent Logic)

## Objective
Reduce the token footprint of the professional resume optimization engine by extracting agent-specific development governance (which only affects the AI's behavior in this dev environment) into a separate "Shadow Module."

## Steps
1. [x] **Audit & Identify:** Perform a full scan of `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` to identify all sections that are `agent-specific` (e.g., G42, local file paths, git governance rules, implementation plan mandates).
2. [x] **Create Governance Module:** Create `docs/governance/agent-governance.md` with the extracted rules.
3. [x] **Shadow Sync Implementation:** 
   - Replace the blocks in `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` with `<modular_reference>` tags within "Silent Sync" HTML markers.
   - This ensures the Gold Master stays updated but the "Logic" is centralized.
4. [x] **GUI Exclusion:** Verify that `Project-GUI-Instructions.md` does NOT include this module, directly reducing the token usage for user-facing artifacts.
5. [x] **Validation:** Re-run the G40 process to ensure the agent still adheres to the extracted rules.
