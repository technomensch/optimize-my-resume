# v8.2.0 - Job Fit Assessment Module Extraction (Archived)

Extract the Job Fit Assessment logic into a standalone module to reduce the context size of the GUI entry point.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Job Fit Assessment

#### [NEW] [job-fit-assessment.md](file:///Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/optimize-my-resume/optimization-tools/job-fit-analyzer/job-fit-assessment.md)
- Create new module containing the full Phase 3 pre-generation assessment logic.

#### [MODIFY] [PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/optimize-my-resume/PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Add "Silent Sync" HTML comments around the Job Fit Assessment section.

#### [MODIFY] [Project-GUI-Instructions.md](file:///Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/optimize-my-resume/Project-GUI-Instructions.md)
- Replace redundant logic with an active modular reference.
- Verify token savings (~1,000 lines).

## Verification Plan
- Bit-for-bit matching between module and Gold Master.
- Confirm 30% reduction in GUI entry point size.
