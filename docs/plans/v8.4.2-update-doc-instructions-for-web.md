# v8.4.2 - Update Documentation Instructions for Web Artifacts

## Goal
Update `Project-GUI-Instructions.md` to:
1. Remove all "Phase" terminology and replace with tool names
2. Add path resolution documentation for Claude web artifacts
3. Create upload guide for modular Claude usage

---

## Issue 1: Replace Phase Terminology with Tool Names

### Naming Conversion

| Remove | Replace With |
|--------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Full Resume Analysis | **Resume Analyzer** |
| Phase 2: Bullet Optimization | **Bullet Optimizer** |
| Phase 3: JD Comparison | **Job Fit Analyzer** |
| Phase 4: Summary Generation | **Narrative Generator** |

### Files to Update

#### [MODIFY] [Project-GUI-Instructions.md](file:///Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/optimize-my-resume/Project-GUI-Instructions.md)

**Changes:**
- Replace `<phase id="1" name="full_resume_analysis">` → `<resume_analyzer>`
- Replace `<phase id="2" name="bullet_optimization">` → `<bullet_optimizer>`
- Replace `<phase id="3" name="jd_comparison">` → `<job_fit_analyzer>`
- Replace `<phase_detection>` → `<tool_routing>`
- Update all comments referencing "Phase 1/2/3/4" to use tool names
- Update `<phase_1_completion_next_steps>` → `<resume_analyzer_completion_next_steps>`
- Update `<phase_1_analysis_report_output>` → `<resume_analyzer_report_output>`
- Update `<phase_3_pre_generation_assessment>` → `<job_fit_pre_generation_assessment>`
- Update routing scenarios to reference tool names instead of phases

**Search patterns to find and replace:**
- `Phase 1` → `Resume Analyzer`
- `Phase 2` → `Bullet Optimizer`
- `Phase 3` → `Job Fit Analyzer`
- `Phase 4` → `Narrative Generator`
- `phase id="1"` → tool-based XML tag
- `phase id="2"` → tool-based XML tag
- `phase id="3"` → tool-based XML tag

## Issue 2: Add Path Resolution for Claude Web Artifacts

### New Section to Add

Add a `<path_resolution>` section after `<system_maintenance_rule>` that explains path differences:

```xml
<path_resolution>
  <claude_web_artifact>
    When using this system as a Claude Project with uploaded files:
    - Files uploaded to Project Knowledge are accessible via /files/[filename.md]
    - Example: optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/job-history-creation.md → /files/job-history-creation.md
    - The system will auto-resolve paths based on context
  </claude_web_artifact>
  
  <local_repository>
    When using the full repository locally or with Claude Desktop:
    - Use paths relative to project root
    - Example: optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/job-history-creation.md
  </local_repository>

  <modular_reference_behavior>
    All `<modular_reference file="...">` tags resolve automatically based on context.
    If file is not found at the specified path, check /files/ prefix.
  </modular_reference_behavior>
</path_resolution>
```

---

## Issue 3: Add Upload Guide Section

### New Section to Add

Add an `<upload_guide>` section that documents which files to upload for Claude web usage:

```xml
<upload_guide>
  <minimum_setup>
    For full functionality, upload ONE of:
    - Project-GUI-Instructions.md (for Claude Projects)
    - quick-start-phase.md (for other LLMs)
    Plus: Your resume file (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
  </minimum_setup>

  <modular_setup>
    For reduced token usage, upload only the modules you need:
    
    <for_resume_analysis>
      - optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/job-history-creation.md
      - optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/entry-router.md
      - optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/job-history-template.md
      - optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/resume-analyzer-display.md
    </for_resume_analysis>

    <for_bullet_optimization>
      - optimization-tools/bullet-optimizer/evidence-matching.md
      - optimization-tools/bullet-optimizer/bullet-generation-logic.md
    </for_bullet_optimization>

    <for_job_fit_analysis>
      - optimization-tools/job-fit-analyzer/job-fit-assessment.md
      - optimization-tools/job-fit-analyzer/workflow-router.md
    </for_job_fit_analysis>

    <for_narrative_generation>
      - optimization-tools/narrative-generator/summary-generation.md
    </for_narrative_generation>
  </modular_setup>
</upload_guide>
```

## Issue Cleanup: Close Resolved v8.3.x Issues

### Background
Issues #30, #32, #42, #43, #44 were all implemented and merged in v8.3.0 and v8.3.1 but remain open in GitHub.

### Actions

#### Close Issue #30
```bash
gh issue close 30 --comment "Resolved in v8.3.0. quality-gates-guardrails.md extracted to optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/. See CHANGELOG.md v8.3.0 entry."
```

#### Close Issue #32
```bash
gh issue close 32 --comment "Resolved in v8.3.0 and v8.3.1. All module references updated in PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md. See CHANGELOG.md v8.3.0 and v8.3.1 entries."
```

#### Close Issue #42
```bash
gh issue close 42 --comment "Resolved in v8.3.1. Guardrail #30 (Modularity Compliance) and Guardrail #31 (Workflow Lifecycle) implemented. See CHANGELOG.md v8.3.1 entry."
```

#### Close Issue #43
```bash
gh issue close 43 --comment "Resolved in v8.3.1. Implemented causal_impact_linking, portfolio_employment_safety, and action_verb_visuals in bullet-generation-logic.md. See CHANGELOG.md v8.3.1 entry."
```

#### Close Issue #44
```bash
gh issue close 44 --comment "Resolved in v8.3.1. Chronology depth logic implemented with 6-year recency threshold and 5-year tenure significance. See CHANGELOG.md v8.3.1 entry."
```

### Verification
```bash
# Verify all issues are closed
gh issue list --state closed | grep -E "#30|#32|#42|#43|#44"
```

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Search `Project-GUI-Instructions.md` for any remaining "Phase" references
2. Confirm all XML tags use tool-based naming
3. Validate path resolution section is correctly placed
4. Validate upload guide section is complete

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify no "Phase 1/2/3/4" references remain (should return 0 matches)
grep -c "Phase [1-4]" Project-GUI-Instructions.md

# Verify tool names are present
grep -c "Resume Analyzer" Project-GUI-Instructions.md
grep -c "Bullet Optimizer" Project-GUI-Instructions.md
grep -c "Job Fit Analyzer" Project-GUI-Instructions.md
grep -c "Narrative Generator" Project-GUI-Instructions.md
```
