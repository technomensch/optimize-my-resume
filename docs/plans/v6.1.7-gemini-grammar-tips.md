# implementation_plan.md - v6.1.7 Gemini Grammar Tips

This plan outlines the integration of Quality Assurance rules for grammar, consistency, and variation into the Optimize-My-Resume system instructions. These rules aim to improve the quality, readability, and ATS-friendliness of generated resume content.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This update adds a new `<quality_assurance_rules>` section to the system instructions, which will increase the token count of the prompt but significantly improve output quality.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Configuration and Documentation

#### [MODIFY] [PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Insert the `<quality_assurance_rules>` section (including `phrase_variation_rule`, `symbol_consistency_rule`, `verb_tense_rule`, `keyword_diversity_rule`, and `pre_output_quality_checklist`) between `<critical_formatting_rules>` and `<character_limits>`.

#### [MODIFY] [quick-start-phase.md](quick-start-phase.md)
- Mirror the changes from `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` to ensure the single-file version is up to date.

#### [MODIFY] [format-rules.md](core/format-rules.md)
- Add a new section "Quality Assurance Rules" to document these standards in the core configuration folder.

#### [MODIFY] [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md)
- Add v6.1.6 entry describing the new grammar and quality assurance rules.

#### [MODIFY] [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- Mark v6.1.6 as complete (once implemented).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the new section is correctly placed in `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `quick-start-phase.md`.
- Ensure no XML tags are broken during insertion.
- Check that `core/format-rules.md` accurately reflects the new rules.
