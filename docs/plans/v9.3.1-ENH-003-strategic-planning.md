# Implementation Plan: v9.3.1-ENH-003-strategic-planning

**Title:** Bullet Generation: Strategic Logic Separation
**Issue:** ENH-003 (Local Tracking)
**GitHub Issue:** To be created via `gh issue create`
**Version:** 9.3.1
**Branch:** `v9.3.1-ENH-003-strategic-planning`

## Governance & Tracking (Guardrail #31)
1. **Establish ID:** `gh issue create --title "v9.3.1: Bullet Generation Strategic Planning" --body-file docs/plans/v9.3.1-ENH-003-strategic-planning.md`
2. **Establish Locality:** `git checkout -b v9.3.1-ENH-003-strategic-planning`
3. **Establish Link:** `gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: v9.3.1 Strategic Planning" --body "Closes #<ISSUE_ID>"`

## Problem Statement
The separation of concerns between `ng_summary-generation.md` (for Professional Summaries) and the upcoming `bo_bullet-generation-instructions.md` (for resume bullets) must be formalized. This prevents logic bleed where summary-specific rules (like 50% keyword overlap) are incorrectly applied to individual bullets, or vice versa.

## Proposed Changes

> **Execution Protocol:** This plan must be executed via `/execute-plan docs/plans/v9.3.1-ENH-003-strategic-planning.md`. No improvements, no deviations.

### 1. Logic Separation Audit
- **[AUDIT] [optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md](optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md)**
  - Identify any rogue "bullet optimization" instructions that should be moved to the Bullet Optimizer hub.
  - Formalize the transition trigger: Summary generation should leverage bullet generation results, not dictate them.

### 2. Guardrail Mapping
- **[MODIFY] [docs/enhancements/ENH-003/logic-map.md](docs/enhancements/ENH-003/logic-map.md)**
  - Create a mapping document that explicitly assigns Guardrails to either the Summary Hub or the Bullet Hub.

## Verification Plan
1. **Logic Consistency:** Verify no overlapping instructions exist between the two logic hubs.
2. **Workflow Routing:** Confirm the `.agent/workflows/generate-bullets.md` (to be created in v9.3.2) correctly identifies which hub to call.
