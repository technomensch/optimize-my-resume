# Implementation Plan: v9.3.5.4-ENH-007-Skills-Prep

**STATUS:** 🔴 STOPPED (Ready for Approval)
**GOVERNANCE:** Atomic Approval Required
**SCOPE:** Infrastructure Prep for Positional Skills Inventory (Format-Agnostic Citing)

## Objective
Establish the logic baseline for the **Evidence-Only Rule** for the Skills Inventory (Section 12). This ensures that every skill listed—whether in a standardized Job History file or a raw resume upload—is explicitly cited back to a specific position (Pos-ID) where it was demonstrated. This prevents "Skill Bloat" and unverified claims.

## Steps
1. **Define Positional Tagging Logic:** Draft the specific instruction for "on-the-fly" tagging. When a raw resume is received, I must assign index-based IDs (e.g., `P1`, `P2`) immediately to serve as anchors for Section 12 citations.
2. **Draft Evidence-Gate Rule:** Define the validation logic that blocks a skill from entering the inventory if it cannot be traced to at least one Pos-ID.
3. **Log Prep:** Add v9.3.5.4 to the local `docs/issue-tracker.md` as a local-only infrastructure task.
