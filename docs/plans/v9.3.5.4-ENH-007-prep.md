# Implementation Plan: v9.3.5.4-ENH-007-Skills-Prep

**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE
**GOVERNANCE:** Atomic Approval Required
**SCOPE:** Infrastructure Prep for Positional Skills Inventory (Format-Agnostic Citing)

This ensures that every skill listed—whether in a standardized Job History file or a raw resume upload—is explicitly cited back to a specific position (Pos-ID) where it was demonstrated. This prevents "Skill Bloat" and unverified claims.

## Steps
1. [x] **Define Positional Tagging Logic:** Drafted G43 for on-the-fly tagging.\n2. [x] **Draft Evidence-Gate Rule:** Drafted G44 for Section 12 blocking.\n3. [x] **Log Prep:** Updated `docs/issue-tracker.md`.\n
