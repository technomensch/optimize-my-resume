# v6.1.5 - Test Case Gap-Filling (Planning Only)

## Goal
Generate a comprehensive instruction set for Claude Opus to create 30+ new test cases for Phases 2-4, addressing gaps identified in current test coverage.

## Context
- v6.1.0 development is structured as individual work chunks.
- Sub-version v6.1.5 focuses on providing the necessary logic and context for an external model (Opus) to expand the test suite.
- Gaps include Phase 2 integration, Phase 3 workflow operations, and Phase 4 summary quality.

## Deliverable
- **docs/plans/v6.1.5-opus-test-instructions.md**: A detailed instruction set for Opus, including identified gaps, required test cases, and expected output format.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Instruction file created with 32 defined test scenarios.
- [ ] Clear formatting and technical context provided for Opus.
- [ ] No direct modification of `v6.0-deep-dive-test-cases.md` (to be performed by Opus).

## Next Steps
- Pass `v6.1.5-opus-test-instructions.md` to Opus for test case generation.
- Merge the resulting test cases into the repository in a future step.
