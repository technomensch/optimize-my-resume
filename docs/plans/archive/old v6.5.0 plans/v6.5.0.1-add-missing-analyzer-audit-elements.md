# Resume Optimization System - v6.5.1 Plan: Add Missing Analyzer Audit Elements

**Version:** 6.5.1
**Date:** January 2026
**Purpose:** To surgically add the detailed, per-bullet audit and repair elements from the `Resume_Analyzer_Wireframe_Draft.md`. This plan bridges the gap between the data generation of prior plans (v6.4.1-v6.4.3) and the granular, actionable display shown in the wireframe.

---

## Executive Summary

Previous plans (v6.4.1-v6.4.3) implemented core data generation for Phase 1 analysis, including metric detection, verb categorization, job history summaries, and the hiring manager perspective. However, the output display remains high-level.

The official wireframe specifies a much more detailed, per-bullet audit display that provides users with granular, inline feedback. This includes a breakdown of why each bullet passes or fails specific checks (Metrics, Action Verb, Character Count) and a prioritized summary of all required repairs.

This plan authorizes the implementation of these missing wireframe elements to complete the vision of the Phase 1 Resume Analyzer output.

## 1. New Instruction: Per-Bullet Audit Display

A new instruction will be added to define the detailed analysis table displayed beneath each resume bullet.

**Location in Instructions:** After `<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>`

```xml
<per_bullet_audit_rules>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis Report</applies_to>

  <purpose>
    To display a detailed analysis table beneath every bullet point in the resume, providing granular, line-by-line feedback based on the wireframe design. This makes the analysis highly actionable and easy to understand.
  </purpose>

  <integration_rule>
    To conserve tokens and avoid redundancy, this audit display must be SURGICALLY INTEGRATED with the existing bullet point output. The bullet point text itself should NOT be duplicated. The audit table should appear directly after the original bullet point.
  </integration_rule>

  <analysis_table_structure>
    <description>
      A three-row table will be displayed directly under each bullet point. Each row corresponds to a specific quality check.
    </description>
    <row id="1" name="Metrics">
      <column_1>Metrics</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If metrics are detected (per v6.4.1/v6.4.2 rules).
        - "Failed": If no metrics are detected.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": List the metrics found (e.g., "65% reduction, 2.5M transactions").
        - On "Failed": Provide a suggestion (e.g., "Add: # of documents, team members trained...").
      </column_3>
    </row>
    <row id="2" name="Action Verb">
      <column_1>Action Verb</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If verb is strong and not redundant.
        - "Weak": If verb is passive (e.g., "Worked on").
        - "Redundant": If the same verb category is used in a nearby bullet.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": Show the verb category and the verb itself (e.g., "🔵 Built: Architected").
        - On "Weak": Explain why it's weak and suggest alternatives.
        - On "Redundant": Note the redundancy and suggest alternatives.
      </column_3>
    </row>
    <row id="3" name="Char Count">
      <column_1>Char Count</column_1>
      <column_2>
        - "Passed": If character count is within the target range (e.g., 100-210).
        - "Failed": If character count is too short or too long.
      </column_2>
      <column_3>
        - On "Passed": Show the count (e.g., "178/210").
        - On "Failed": Show the count and how far it is from the minimum/maximum.
      </column_3>
    </row>
  </analysis_table_structure>

  <per_bullet_recommendations>
    <description>
      If any check in the analysis table fails, a "RECOMMENDATIONS" box will appear below the table for that bullet.
    </description>
    <trigger>One or more "Failed", "Weak", or "Redundant" results in the table.</trigger>
    <format>
      - Group all recommendations for the bullet in one box.
      - Prefix each recommendation with its severity: [⚠️ RISK] or [🔧 TWEAK].
      - Example: "[⚠️ RISK] Missing metrics - add quantified achievements."
    </format>
  </per_bullet_recommendations>

  <example_display>
    [P1-B4] Created technical documentation and training materials.
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ||   Metrics   ||   Failed   || Lacks quantifiable impact
    ||             ||            || Add: # of documents, team members trained...
    ||─────────────||────────────||────────────────────────────────────────────────
    || Action Verb ||   Passed   || 🔵 Built: Created
    ||─────────────||────────────||────────────────────────────────────────────────
    || Char Count  ||   Failed   || 62/210 (38 chars below minimum)
    ||─────────────||────────────||────────────────────────────────────────────────
    || ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS (2 items)
    ||
    ||   [⚠️ RISK] Missing metrics - add quantified achievements
    ||   [⚠️ RISK] Bullet too short (62 chars) - expand with context/outcomes
    ||
    ||───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  </example_display>
</per_bullet_audit_rules>
```

## 2. New Instruction: Prioritized Repairs & Verdict Summary

This instruction adds the summary and verdict sections from the wireframe, providing a high-level overview of the audit results. This feature was noted in project changelogs but is not present in recent plans.

**Location in Instructions:** After `<per_bullet_audit_rules>`

```xml
<prioritized_repairs_summary_rules>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis Report</applies_to>
  <purpose>
    To provide a high-level, prioritized summary of all identified issues, matching the wireframe's "Executive Summary" and "Prioritized Repairs Summary" sections.
  </purpose>

  <severity_levels>
    <level id="blocker" symbol="⛔">Dealbreakers that risk auto-rejection.</level>
    <level id="risk" symbol="⚠️">Significant issues that lower the resume's score and impact.</level>
    <level id="tweak" symbol="🔧">Minor refinements for professional polish.</level>
  </severity_levels>

  <executive_summary_integration>
    <description>
      The main executive summary at the top of the report will be updated to include:
    </description>
    <rule priority="critical">
      This executive summary MUST be the first element in the output to provide an immediate, high-level overview.
    </rule>
    <element name="Prioritized Repairs Counts">
      - A one-line summary of issue counts by severity.
      - Example: "[⛔ BLOCKER: 0]       [⚠️ RISK: 4]       [🔧 TWEAK: 6]"
    </element>
    <element name="The Verdict">
      - A concise, one-sentence summary of the resume's overall status.
      - Example: "Your resume is ATS COMPATIBLE, but needs CONTENT improvements for impact."
    </element>
    <element name="Repair Legend">
      - A legend explaining the meaning of the Blocker, Risk, and Tweak symbols.
    </element>
  </executive_summary_integration>

  <final_summary_section>
    <description>
      A new section titled "PRIORITIZED REPAIRS SUMMARY" will be added at the end of the entire report.
    </description>
    <structure>
      - Issues will be grouped by severity ([⚠️ RISK] then [🔧 TWEAK]).
      - Each issue will reference its location (e.g., "[P1-B4]").
      - Each issue will provide a concise description and an actionable fix suggestion.
    </structure>
    <example>
      [⚠️ RISK] - 4 issues (Significant Impact - Lowers Score)
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      1. [P1-B4] Missing metrics - add quantified achievements
         → Add: "Created 25+ technical documents, reducing onboarding time by 30%"
    </example>
  </final_summary_section>
</prioritized_repairs_summary_rules>
```

## 3. Update to `<phase_1_analysis_report_output>`

The existing output structure for the Phase 1 report must be updated to incorporate these new, granular display elements.

**Modification:** Update `report_structure` within `<phase_1_analysis_report_output>`.

```xml
<phase_1_analysis_report_output>
  ...
  <report_structure>
    <section id="1" name="Executive Summary">
      ...
      <!-- ADD a sub-section for the verdict and repairs summary -->
      <sub_section name="Verdict and Repairs">
        <reference>Implement per prioritized_repairs_summary_rules</reference>
        - Display "Prioritized Repairs" counts (Blocker, Risk, Tweak).
        - Display "The Verdict" summary sentence.
        - Display "Repair Legend".
      </sub_section>
    </section>

    ...

    <section id="4" name="Position-by-Position Bullet Review">
      For each position (in document order):
      1. Display position header.
      2. For each bullet:
         a. Display the bullet (with metric indicator and colored verb per v6.4.1).
         b. **Display the new per-bullet audit table directly below it (per per_bullet_audit_rules).**
         c. **If needed, display the per-bullet recommendations box (per per_bullet_audit_rules).**
      3. Display position summary statistics.
      4. Visual separator between positions.
    </section>

    ...
    <!-- ADD the final, detailed repairs list at the end of the report -->
    <section id="6" name="Prioritized Repairs Summary">
        <reference>Implement per prioritized_repairs_summary_rules</reference>
        - Display detailed list of all RISKS and TWEAKS with actionable suggestions.
    </section>
  </report_structure>
  ...
</phase_1_analysis_report_output>
```

---

## Implementation Checklist

- **Logic:**
    - [ ] Develop function to evaluate `Metrics`, `Action Verb`, and `Char Count` for each bullet and return a `Passed`/`Failed`/`Weak` status.
    - [ ] Develop function to generate specific recommendations based on failure type.
    - [ ] Create a system to aggregate all identified issues (Risks, Tweaks) from across the resume.
- **Display Components:**
    - [ ] Create UI component for the per-bullet `analysis_table_structure`.
    - [ ] Create UI component for the per-bullet `recommendations` box.
    - [ ] Update the Executive Summary UI to include `Verdict` and `Prioritized Repairs` counts.
    - [ ] Create UI component for the final `Prioritized Repairs Summary` list.
- **Integration:**
    - [ ] Ensure the new components are correctly integrated into the main report flow.
    - [ ] Verify that issue severity (Risk, Tweak) is consistently applied in per-bullet recommendations and the final summary.
