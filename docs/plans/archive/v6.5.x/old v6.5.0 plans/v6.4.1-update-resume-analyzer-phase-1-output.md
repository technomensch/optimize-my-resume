## Phase 1: Complete Implementation

### 1. Bullet Color-Coding Rules

**Location in Instructions:** After `<action_verb_categories>`

```xml
<bullet_color_coding_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Visually identify action verb categories by coloring the first word of each bullet.
    Helps users quickly assess verb diversity and achievement types.
  </purpose>

  <color_mapping>
    <category verb="Built" color="blue" hex="#3B82F6">
      Creates new systems/products/processes
      Verbs: built, developed, designed, launched, established, implemented, created, engineered, architected, pioneered
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Lead" color="orange" hex="#FBBF24">
      Drives initiatives, guides teams
      Verbs: led, directed, spearheaded, drove, championed, headed, piloted, steered, mentored, coached
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Managed" color="purple" hex="#A855F7">
      Oversees resources, coordinates operations
      Verbs: managed, supervised, coordinated, oversaw, administered, orchestrated, facilitated, organized, planned, prioritized
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Improved" color="green" hex="#10B981">
      Optimizes and enhances existing systems
      Verbs: optimized, improved, streamlined, enhanced, transformed, upgraded, refined, boosted, increased, reduced
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Collaborate" color="pink" hex="#EC4899">
      Partners cross-functionally, works with teams
      Verbs: collaborated, partnered, cooperated, coordinated, facilitated, liaised, worked with, teamed with, consulted, advised
    </category>
  </color_mapping>

  <implementation_rules>
    <rule priority="critical">
      Extract the first word of each bullet (the action verb).
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="critical">
      Match the first word against verb lists (case-insensitive).
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="critical">
      Apply corresponding color to the first word ONLY.
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="high">
      If verb not found in categories, display in default color (gray).
    </rule>
  </implementation_rules>

  <display_format>
    [METRIC_INDICATOR] [COLORED_VERB] [rest of bullet text]
    
    Example:
    ✓ [Blue]Built a real-time analytics dashboard using React
    − [Orange]Led cross-functional team of 8 engineers
  </display_format>
</bullet_color_coding_rules>
```

---

### 2. Metrics Detection Rules

**Location in Instructions:** After `<bullet_color_coding_rules>`

```xml
<bullet_metrics_detection_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Visually indicate which bullets contain quantified metrics.
    Helps users identify which bullets have impact evidence.
  </purpose>

  <metric_types_recognized>
    <type pattern="\d+%">Percentages (50%, 3.2%)</type>
    <type pattern="\$\d+">Currency ($2M, $500K)</type>
    <type pattern="~\d+">Approximations (~40, ~10%)</type>
    <type pattern="\d+x">Multipliers (3x, 10x)</type>
    <type pattern="from \d+ to \d+">Ranges (from 3s to 0.8s)</type>
    <type pattern="\d+ (seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks|months|years)">Time (3 days, 2 weeks)</type>
    <type pattern="\d+ (users|customers|clients|transactions|records|items|pages)">Volume (500 users, 10K transactions)</type>
    <type pattern="(Top|First) \d+">Rankings (Top 10, First 5)</type>
  </metric_types_recognized>

  <detection_algorithm>
    1. Scan each bullet for any metric pattern above
    2. If ANY metric found: Mark as "HAS METRICS" ✓
    3. If NO metrics found: Mark as "NO METRICS" −
  </detection_algorithm>

  <display_format>
    ✓ (Green indicator) = Bullet contains quantified metric(s)
    − (Gray indicator) = Bullet lacks quantified metrics
    
    Example:
    ✓ Built analytics dashboard reducing load time by 60%
    − Led cross-functional team on platform migration
  </display_format>

  <reporting_in_phase_1>
    Per position:
    "Metrics Coverage: X/Y bullets have quantified impact (XX%)
     Target: 70-80% of bullets should contain metrics"
  </reporting_in_phase_1>
</bullet_metrics_detection_rules>
```

### 3. Bullet Display and Grouping Rules

**Location in Instructions:** After `<bullet_metrics_detection_rules>`

```xml
<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Define standard format for displaying bullets.
    Ensures consistency: color-coded verbs + metrics detection + position grouping.
  </purpose>

  <grouping_logic>
    <order>Document order (positions appear in order they appear in resume)</order>
    <grouping_unit>By position title/header</grouping_unit>
    
    <position_header_format>
      [Position Title] - [Company Name] - [Date Range]
    </position_header_format>
  </grouping_logic>

  <bullet_display_within_position>
    For each bullet:
    [METRIC_INDICATOR] [COLOR_CODED_VERB] [bullet text]
    
    Where:
    - METRIC_INDICATOR: ✓ (green) or − (gray)
    - COLOR_CODED_VERB: First word colored per color_mapping
    - bullet text: remainder of the bullet
  </bullet_display_within_position>

  <position_summary>
    After all bullets for a position:
    - Total bullets in position: X
    - Bullets with metrics: X (XX%)
    - Verb category breakdown: Built (X), Lead (X), Managed (X), Improved (X), Collaborate (X)
  </position_summary>

  <example_display>
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Senior Technical Writer at TechCorp | Jan 2022 - Present
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    ✓ [Built] NIST-compliant CONOPS documentation for 40+ cloud initiatives
    − [Led] Documentation standards committee across 3 agencies
    ✓ [Managed] 15-person technical writing team and $500K annual budget
    ✓ [Improved] Compliance audit pass rate from 85% to 98%
    − [Collaborated] With engineers on technical architecture documentation
    
    Position Summary:
    • Total bullets: 5
    • With metrics: 3 (60%)
    • Verb distribution: Built (1), Lead (1), Managed (1), Improved (1), Collaborate (1)
  </example_display>
</bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>
```

### 4. Word/Google Docs Parsing Compatibility

**Location in Instructions:** After `<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>`

```xml
<word_google_docs_parsing_compatibility>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <version>6.4.1-update-1</version>
  <date>January 2026</date>
  
  <purpose>
    Handle resumes copied from Word/Google Docs where bullet formatting 
    and indentation is lost in plain text conversion.
  </purpose>

  <problem_addressed>
    When copying from Word/Google Docs, special bullet characters (•) and 
    indentation formatting are lost. This causes the parser to group all 
    content under the first position header.
    
    Solution: Implement intelligent position header detection based on patterns
    rather than relying on indentation or bullet markers.
  </problem_addressed>

  <position_header_detection_algorithm>
    A line is identified as a position header if it:
    
    1. Contains position markers: " at " OR "|" OR company keywords
    2. Has reasonable length: 10-150 characters
    3. Is NOT a bullet marker (•, -, *, o, ◦, ○, numbered)
    
    Position markers include:
    - " at " pattern (Job Title at Company Name)
    - "|" separator (Title | Company | Dates)
    - Company keywords: Inc, LLC, Corp, Company, Corp., Ltd, etc.
    - Date patterns: YYYY, Month Year, dates
    
    When a position header is detected:
    - Save previous position (if it has collected bullets)
    - Start new position with this line as header
    - Collect following lines as bullets until next header found
  </position_header_detection_algorithm>

  <bullet_marker_support>
    The parser supports bullets from any source:
    
    Standard markers:
    - • (standard bullet)
    - - (hyphen)
    - * (asterisk)
    
    Unicode bullets:
    - o ◦ ○ ● ■ □ ▪
    
    Numbered lists:
    - 1. 2. 3. etc.
    
    Word/Google Docs:
    - Plain text with intelligent position header detection
    - Lines between position headers are treated as bullets
  </bullet_marker_support>

  <implementation_notes>
    - Once a position header is detected, all following non-header lines become bullets
    - Bullets shorter than 5 characters are skipped (noise reduction)
    - Remove all bullet markers and leading whitespace from collected text
    - If a line looks like a position header, save current position and start new one
  </implementation_notes>
</word_google_docs_parsing_compatibility>
