## UPDATE 1: Bullet Color-Coding Rules

**Location:** After `<action_verb_categories>` and before `<critical_formatting_rules>`

**Action:** CREATE new tag

**Content:**

```xml
<bullet_color_coding_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>All phases where bullets are displayed (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3)</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Visually identify action verb categories by coloring the first word of each bullet.
    This helps users quickly assess verb diversity and understand achievement types at a glance.
  </purpose>

  <color_mapping>
    <category verb="Built" color="blue" hex="#3B82F6">
      Creates new systems/products/processes
      Verbs: built, developed, designed, launched, established, implemented, created, engineered, architected, pioneered
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Lead" color="orange" hex="#FBBF24">
      Drives initiatives, guides teams
      Verbs: led, directed, spearheaded, drove, championed, headed, piloted, steered, mentored, coached
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Managed" color="purple" hex="#A855F7">
      Oversees resources, coordinates operations
      Verbs: managed, supervised, coordinated, oversaw, administered, orchestrated, facilitated, organized, planned, prioritized
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Improved" color="green" hex="#10B981">
      Optimizes and enhances existing systems
      Verbs: optimized, improved, streamlined, enhanced, transformed, upgraded, refined, boosted, increased, reduced
    </category>
    
    <category verb="Collaborate" color="pink" hex="#EC4899">
      Partners cross-functionally, works with teams
      Verbs: collaborated, partnered, cooperated, coordinated, facilitated, liaised, worked with, teamed with, consulted, advised
    </category>
  </color_mapping>

  <implementation_rules>
    <rule priority="critical">
      Extract the first word of each bullet (the action verb).
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="critical">
      Match the first word against the verb lists above (case-insensitive).
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="critical">
      Apply the corresponding color to the first word ONLY.
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="high">
      If verb is not found in any category, display in default color (white/gray).
    </rule>
    
    <rule priority="high">
      Color coding applies to visual display ONLY - does not change the actual bullet text.
    </rule>
  </implementation_rules>

## UPDATE 2: Bullet Metrics Detection Rules

**Location:** After `<bullet_color_coding_rules>` (immediately following UPDATE 1)

**Action:** CREATE new tag

**Content:**

```xml
<bullet_metrics_detection_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>All phases where bullets are displayed (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3)</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Visually indicate whether each bullet contains quantified metrics.
    This helps users see which bullets have impact evidence and which need strengthening.
  </purpose>

  <metric_types_recognized>
    <type pattern="\d+%">Percentages (e.g., "50%", "3.2%")</type>
    <type pattern="\$\d+">Currency (e.g., "$2M", "$500K", "$1.2B")</type>
    <type pattern="~\d+">Approximations (e.g., "~40", "~10%")</type>
    <type pattern="\d+x">Multipliers (e.g., "3x", "10x")</type>
    <type pattern="from \d+ to \d+">Ranges/improvements (e.g., "from 3s to 0.8s")</type>
    <type pattern="\d+ (seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks|months|years)">Time-based (e.g., "3 days", "2 weeks")</type>
    <type pattern="\d+ (users|customers|clients|transactions|records|items|pages)">Volume-based (e.g., "500 users", "10K transactions")</type>
    <type pattern="(Top|First) \d+">Rankings (e.g., "Top 10", "First 5")</type>
  </metric_types_recognized>

  <detection_algorithm>
    1. Scan each bullet for any metric pattern above
    2. If ANY metric found: Mark bullet as "HAS METRICS" ✓
    3. If NO metrics found: Mark bullet as "NO METRICS" -
  </detection_algorithm>

  <display_format>
    When displaying bullets, add a metric indicator next to each bullet:
    
    ✓ (Green checkmark) = Bullet contains quantified metric(s)
    - (Gray dash) = Bullet lacks quantified metrics
  </display_format>

  <reporting_in_phase_1>
    In Phase 1 Resume Analysis Report, include summary per position:
    
    "Metrics Coverage: X/Y bullets have quantified impact (XX%)
     Target: 70-80% of bullets should contain metrics"
  </reporting_in_phase_1>
</bullet_metrics_detection_rules>
```

## UPDATE 3: Bullet Display and Grouping Rules

**Location:** After `<bullet_metrics_detection_rules>` (immediately following UPDATE 2)

**Action:** CREATE new tag

**Content:**

```xml
<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Analysis Report, Phase 2 Optimization, Phase 3 JD Comparison</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Define standard format for displaying bullets across all phases.
    Ensures consistency: color-coded verbs + metrics detection + job title grouping.
  </purpose>

  <grouping_logic>
    <order>Reverse chronological (most recent job first)</order>
    <grouping_unit>By job title + company</grouping_unit>
    
    <position_header_format>
      [Job Title] at [Company] | [Start Date] - [End Date]
      Duration: [X years/months]
    </position_header_format>
  </grouping_logic>
  
  <bullet_display_within_position>
    For each bullet in the position:
    [METRIC_INDICATOR] [COLOR_CODED_VERB] [bullet text]
    
    Where:
    - METRIC_INDICATOR: ✓ (green) or - (gray) - placed at left
    - COLOR_CODED_VERB: First word colored per bullet_color_coding_rules
    - bullet text: remainder of the bullet
  </bullet_display_within_position>
  
  <position_summary>
    After all bullets for a position, display:
    - Total bullets in position: X
    - Bullets with metrics: X (XX%)
    - Verb category breakdown: Built (X), Lead (X), Managed (X), Improved (X), Collaborate (X)
  </position_summary>

## UPDATE 4: Hiring Manager Perspective Rules

**Location:** After `<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>` (immediately following UPDATE 3)

**Action:** CREATE new tag

**Content:**

```xml
<hiring_manager_perspective_rules>
  <priority>HIGH</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis only</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Analyze resume as an external hiring manager or recruiter would.
    Ignore resume job titles and infer actual job title/role based on:
    - Core responsibilities and deliverables
    - Skills demonstrated through achievements
    - Industry context and company type
    - Seniority level implied by scope and impact
    - Career progression patterns
  </purpose>

  <analysis_methodology>
    <step number="1" name="context_gathering">
      For each position in the resume:
      - Read all bullets (responsibilities and achievements)
      - Note the company type and industry
      - Identify scope (team size, budget, customer base, etc.)
      - Assess seniority level
      - Track patterns across positions
    </step>

    <step number="2" name="title_interpretation">
      Infer what the job title likely was, based on actual work.
      Use actual market job titles, not internal or creative titles.
      
      Examples of inference logic:
      - If bullets show: "Managed team", "Set roadmap", "Owned product decisions"
        → Likely: Product Manager, Product Owner
      - If bullets show: "Built systems", "Architected solutions"
        → Likely: Software Engineer, Technical Lead, Engineering Manager
      - If bullets show: "Wrote documentation", "Created user guides"
        → Likely: Technical Writer, Documentation Specialist
    </step>

    <step number="3" name="seniority_assessment">
      Determine seniority level based on:
      - Team leadership (0 = Individual contributor, 3+ = Team lead, 10+ = Manager+)
      - Budget responsibility ($0 = None, $100K+ = Budget owner, $1M+ = Executive)
      - Strategic vs. tactical work (Strategic = Senior, Tactical = Junior)
      - Cross-functional scope (Wide = Senior, Narrow = Junior)
      
      Adjust title with seniority level:
      - Junior/Entry: "Software Engineer", "Junior Developer"
      - Mid-level: "Senior Software Engineer", "Lead Developer"
      - Senior: "Principal Engineer", "Engineering Manager"
    </step>

    <step number="4" name="maintain_position_order">
      Keep positions in chronological order as they appear in resume.
      Do NOT re-order or reorganize positions.
    </step>

    <step number="5" name="reasoning_documentation">
      For each inferred title, document:
      - Which bullets led to this interpretation
      - What specific skills/achievements implied the role
      - How this differs from the stated title (if different)
      - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

## UPDATE 12: Word/Google Docs Parsing Compatibility

**Location:** After `<bullet_display_and_grouping_rules>` (UPDATE 3)

**Action:** CREATE new tag

**Content:**

```xml
<word_google_docs_parsing_compatibility>
  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>
  <applies_to>Phase 1 Resume Analysis</applies_to>
  
  <purpose>
    Handle resumes copied from Word/Google Docs where bullet formatting 
    and indentation may be lost in plain text conversion.
  </purpose>

  <problem_addressed>
    When copying from Word/Google Docs, special bullet characters and 
    indentation formatting may be lost. Solution: Implement intelligent 
    position header detection based on patterns rather than indentation alone.
