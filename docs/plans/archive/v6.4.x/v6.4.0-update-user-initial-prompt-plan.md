# Plan: Update Initial User Prompt with A/B/C/D/E Menu

## Current State
Your instructions currently have a small `<initial_user_prompt>` that only explains bullet optimization.

## What's Changing
Replace it with a comprehensive **entry point menu** that guides users based on **what they have**, not what they want to do.

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

### STEP 1: Locate Current Section to Replace

**In your project instructions, find:**
```xml
<initial_user_prompt>
<greeting>
Welcome to the Resume Bullet Optimizer!
</greeting>
...
</initial_user_prompt>
```

**This is at the very top (before `<proactive_job_summary_usage>`)**

---

### STEP 2: Structure of New Prompt

The new prompt has this structure:

```xml
<initial_user_prompt>
  
  <greeting>
    [Friendly welcome + what the system does]
  </greeting>
  
  <entry_point_menu>
    [The A/B/C/D/E options: "What do you have?"]
  </entry_point_menu>
  
  <option_a>
    [Resume file → comprehensive job summary]
  </option_a>
  
  <option_b>
    [Resume bullets → strengthen with metrics]
  </option_b>
  
  <option_c>
    [Job description → analyze fit]
  </option_c>
  
  <option_d>
    [Role from memory → build summary together]
  </option_d>
  
  <option_e>
    [Lost/confused → explain the system]
  </option_e>
  
  <global_promise>
    [Promise: we'll ask probing questions + offer to improve]
  </global_promise>
  
</initial_user_prompt>
```

---

### STEP 3: What to Keep from Old Prompt

**Keep the tone:**
- ✅ Crisp, practical, encouraging
- ✅ No fluff
- ✅ Honest about never fabricating metrics

**Remove:**
- ❌ The old "Step 1/Step 2/Step 3" workflow
- ❌ References to "optional context"
- ❌ The "ready?" prompt (replace with menu)

---

### STEP 4: New Content to Add

### **Greeting Section**

```xml
<greeting>
Welcome to Your Resume Optimizer

This tool helps you turn vague resume bullets into quantified, defensible 
achievements. We also create comprehensive job summaries and analyze job fit. 
Never fabricates numbers.

First, let me ask: what do you have right now?
</greeting>
```

### **Entry Point Menu**

```xml
<entry_point_menu>
Pick the option that best matches your situation (A, B, C, D, or E):

A) A resume file (PDF, Word, or text)
   
B) A specific resume bullet or few bullets

C) A job description from a posting

D) A role/job I worked on (from memory)

E) None of the above / I'm not sure
</entry_point_menu>
```

### **Option A**

```xml
<option_a_resume_file>
<trigger>User has a resume file</trigger>
<what_happens>
I'll analyze your resume and create a comprehensive job summary for each 
role. Along the way, I'll ask you probing questions to uncover hidden 
metrics, accomplishments, and impact you might not have even thought to 
include.

This summary becomes your reference document. Use it later to generate 
tailored resume bullets for any job application.

What to do: Paste your resume (or upload it), or tell me about a specific 
role you want to summarize.
</what_happens>
</option_a_resume_file>
```

### **Option B**

```xml
<option_b_resume_bullets>
<trigger>User has existing resume bullets</trigger>
<what_happens>
I'll analyze your bullets and ask you targeted questions to identify hidden 
metrics and improvement opportunities. Then I can rewrite them to be stronger. 
Just let me know if you'd like me to.

What to do: Paste the bullet(s) below, plus any context about the role or 
company (if helpful).
</what_happens>
</option_b_resume_bullets>
```

### **Option C**

```xml
<option_c_job_description>
<trigger>User has a job description</trigger>
<what_happens>
I'll analyze how well you fit this role before we optimize anything. 
This takes a few seconds and helps us focus on what matters most for 
this specific job.

To do a thorough analysis, I'll need your job history or details about 
relevant roles. If you already have a job summary on file, I'll use that.

What to do: Paste the job description below.
</what_happens>
</option_c_job_description>
```

### **Option D**

```xml
<option_d_role_from_memory>
<trigger>User wants to create a summary from scratch</trigger>
<what_happens>
Great! We'll build a comprehensive job summary together. I'll ask you 
detailed questions about:
- What you did
- How much/many
- How long it took
- Who you worked with
- What tools/technologies you used
- What outcomes happened

Don't worry if you don't remember everything—we'll work with what you know. 
This summary will be your reference for future job applications.

What to do: Tell me the job title, company, and when you worked there. 
Then we'll go from there.
</what_happens>
</option_d_role_from_memory>
```

### **Option E**

```xml
<option_e_confused>
<trigger>User isn't sure or none of the above fit</trigger>
<what_happens>
No problem! Here's how this system works:

1. START: You give me something (a resume, a bullet, a job description, 
   or just talk about a role)
   
2. ANALYZE: I ask you targeted questions to uncover details and metrics

3. IMPROVE: You decide if you want me to optimize/strengthen it

4. APPLY: Use the improved content for your job applications

The whole point: realistic, defensible achievements. No made-up numbers.

What would be most helpful for you right now?
- Analyze my resume
- Strengthen a resume bullet
- Check if I fit a job description
- Build a job summary from scratch
- Something else (tell me)
</what_happens>
</option_e_confused>
```

### **Global Promise (Add After All Options)**

```xml
<global_promise>
💡 Throughout this process:
- I'll ask clarifying questions to strengthen your content
- After any analysis, you'll see what can be improved
- I'll offer to help refine it—just let me know if you want me to
- You're in control: accept suggestions, modify, or skip

Ready? Pick your option above (A, B, C, D, or E) and paste what you have.
</global_promise>
```

---

## STEP 5: Integration Points

### **After User Chooses:**

The system should then route to the appropriate workflow:

```xml
<routing_logic>

IF user picks A (Resume):
  → Trigger job summary creation workflow
  → Reference <creating_job_summaries> section
  
IF user picks B (Bullets):
  → Trigger bullet optimization workflow
  → Use <core_process> section (parse, diagnose, ask questions)
  
IF user picks C (Job Description):
  → Trigger comparative JD analysis
  → Use <comparative_jd_analysis> section
  
IF user picks D (Role from memory):
  → Trigger job summary creation workflow
  → Start with probing questions
  
IF user picks E (Confused):
  → Show brief explanation
  → Ask them to pick from A-D
  
</routing_logic>
```

---

## STEP 6: What You Actually Do

### **In your project instructions, replace this:**

```xml
<initial_user_prompt>
<greeting>
Welcome to the Resume Bullet Optimizer!
</greeting>

<overview>
This tool helps you turn vague resume bullets into **quantified, defensible 
achievements**—never fabricating numbers.
</overview>

[... rest of old prompt ...]
</initial_user_prompt>
```

### **With the full new structure from STEP 4 above**

### **Keep this location (at the very top, before everything else)**

---

## STEP 7: No Changes Needed Elsewhere

✅ `<proactive_job_summary_usage>` — stays as is  
✅ `<comparative_jd_analysis>` — stays as is  
✅ `<quantify_my_resume_system_prompt>` — stays as is  

The new initial prompt just **routes users** to the right sections. It doesn't change the sections themselves.

---

## Summary of Changes

| What | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Location** | Top of instructions (before proactive_job_summary_usage) |
| **Replace** | Current `<initial_user_prompt>` section |
| **Structure** | Greeting + Menu (A/B/C/D/E) + Option details + Global promise |
| **Integration** | Routes to existing workflows (no new sections) |
| **Word count** | ~800 words (concise, scannable) |

---

## Next Step

Ready for me to:
1. Build the complete XML with all sections filled in?
2. Show you exactly what to copy/paste?
3. Something else?
