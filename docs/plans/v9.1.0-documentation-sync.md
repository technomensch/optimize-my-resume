## Overview

Sync modular instructions and project documentation to reflect features implemented in Should-I-Apply WebGUI v9.0.x releases.

**All issues require Shadow Sync Protocol.**

---

## Issue #65 - Update Post-Analysis Prompt Wording

**Module:** `optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md`

**Change:** Update prompt wording to match the actual post-analysis workflow implemented in Should-I-Apply WebGUI.

**Shadow Sync Required:**
1. Update MODULE: `ng_summary-generation.md`
2. Sync GOLD MASTER: `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Verify ENTRYPOINT: `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`

**Solution Approach:** `docs/issues/issue-65/solution-approach.md`

---

## Issue #66 - Add JD Keywords Display

**Modules:**
- `optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md`
- `optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/ra_jd-parsing.md`

**Change:** Document the JD keywords display feature that shows matched vs missing keywords.

**Shadow Sync Required:**
1. Update MODULES: Both files above
2. Sync GOLD MASTER: `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Verify ENTRYPOINT: `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`

**Solution Approach:** `docs/issues/issue-66/solution-approach.md`

---

## Issue #68 - Document Per-JD Customization Feature

**Modules:**
- `optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md`
- `optimization-tools/job-fit-assessment/jfa_workflow-router.md`

**Change:** Formally document the per-JD customization feature (bullets + professional summary generation).

**Key Points to Document:**
- Only offered when fitScore >= 50
- Follows Guardrail #29 (Metric Preservation)
- Keyword Evidence Principle enforcement
- Character limits (100-210 chars)
- Verb diversity across categories

**Shadow Sync Required:**
1. Update MODULES: Both files above
2. Sync GOLD MASTER: `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Verify ENTRYPOINT: `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`

**Solution Approach:** `docs/issues/issue-68/solution-approach.md`

---

## Files Modified

**Modular Instructions:**
- `optimization-tools/narrative-generator/ng_summary-generation.md` (#65, #66, #68)
- `optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/ra_jd-parsing.md` (#66)
- `optimization-tools/job-fit-assessment/jfa_workflow-router.md` (#68)

**Shadow Sync Targets:**
- `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Gold Master)
- `Project-GUI-Instructions.md` (Entrypoint)

---

## Shadow Sync Protocol

For each issue:
1. **Edit MODULE** - Make specific changes to modular instruction file
2. **Sync GOLD MASTER** - Update PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md with same changes
3. **Verify ENTRYPOINT** - Ensure Project-GUI-Instructions.md references are consistent

**Critical:** All three files must remain in sync. Any change to a module must propagate to Gold Master and be verified at Entrypoint.

---

## Branch Creation

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b v9.1.0-documentation-sync
```

---

## Verification Steps

1. Review each module file for changes
2. Verify PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md reflects all module changes
3. Check Project-GUI-Instructions.md for consistency
4. Search for outdated references or contradictions
5. Ensure terminology is consistent across all files
6. Run diff check between modules and Gold Master sections

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Issue #65 changes documented and synced
- [ ] Issue #66 changes documented and synced
- [ ] Issue #68 changes documented and synced
- [ ] Shadow Sync verified for all three issues
- [ ] No contradictions between files
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] All test cases pass (documentation validation)
- [ ] Ready to merge to main and tag as v9.1.0

---

## Notes

This release is purely documentation - no code changes to WebGUI.

However, it's critical for:
- Maintaining consistency between implementation and documentation
- Enabling proper LLM prompt generation from instructions
- Supporting future development work
