# v6.1.2 - Documentation Updates Implementation Plan

## Goal
Update terminology consistency (Mode → Phase) and add Job Summary feature documentation across user-facing documentation files.

## Background
v6.1.1 renamed `/shared/` → `/phases/` for clearer architecture. v6.1.2 completes the terminology alignment by updating user-facing documentation to use "Phase" instead of "Mode" consistently, and adds documentation for the Job Summary generation feature introduced in v6.0.4.

## Proposed Changes

#### Job Summary Usage Guide (NEW)

Insert after line 271 (after tip #4):

```markdown
### 5. **Use Job Summary Generation for Applications**
   - After Phase 3 analyzes a job description, ask: \"Create a professional summary for this job\"
   - The system generates TWO types of summaries:
     - **Master Summary:** Comprehensive overview of your entire career (stored in job history)
     - **Per-JD Summary:** Customized version optimized for the specific job posting (ephemeral)
   - **Use cases:**
     - Cover letters: Lead with the per-JD summary
     - LinkedIn applications: Paste customized summary in \"Why are you interested?\" section
     - Email applications: Include in the body to show tailored interest
   - **Pro tip:** The per-JD summary includes JD keywords for ATS optimization
```

#### Version Updates

**Lines 407-408**:
- "Current Version:** 6.0.0" → "Current Version:** 6.1.0"
- "Released:** December 29, 2025" (keep date)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
None required - this is documentation-only changes.

### Manual Verification

1. **README.md terminology check:**
   ```bash
   # From project root
   grep -n "Mode [123]" README.md
   # Should return 0 results (all should be "Phase [123]")
   
   grep -n "Phase [123]" README.md | wc -l
   # Should return ~28 results
   ```

2. **Job Summary section exists:**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "Use Job Summary Generation" README.md
   # Should display the new tip section
   ```

3. **Version numbers updated:**
   ```bash
   grep "Version.*6.1.0" README.md
   # Should show updated version
   
   grep "v6.1.0" docs/CHANGELOG.md
   # Should show new changelog entry
   
   grep "v6.1.0" ROADMAP.md
   # Should show new roadmap entry
   ```

4. **Cross-reference validation:**
   - Open README.md and verify all Phase references make sense in context
   - Check that file structure tree (lines 217-228) still references `/phases/` correctly
   - Verify CHANGELOG v6.1.0 entry is properly formatted
   - Verify ROADMAP v6.1.0 entry is marked complete

5. **Git status check:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show 3 modified files: README.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md
   ```
