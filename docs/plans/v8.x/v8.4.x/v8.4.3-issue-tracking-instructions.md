# Implementation Plan - v8.4.3: Issue Tracking Instructions

This plan addresses **Git Issue #50: Fix issue tracking instructions for web UI vs local environments**, adding clear guidance on how to report and track bugs depending on the user's environment (local Git repo vs. Claude Web Interface).

## Goal Description
Standardize the "Bug Reporting" workflow across environments to ensure issues are captured regardless of where the user is executing the system.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Web UI Limitation**: Users in Claude Web UI cannot push to GitHub. The workflow will rely on a manual `discovered_issues.md` artifact or copy-pasting to a known location.

## Proposed Changes

### [Documentation]

#### [MODIFY] [PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Add `<issue_tracking_workflow>` section.
  - **Local**: Use `gh issue create` or GitHub Web UI.
  - **Web UI**: Create/Update `docs/discovered_issues.md` in the chat context or ask the LLM to generate an "Issue Report" block to copy-paste.

#### [MODIFY] [Project-GUI-Instructions.md](file:///Project-GUI-Instructions.md)
- Add a corresponding `<issue_tracking_guide>` for the GUI user.
- Add a specific instruction: "If you encounter an error, ask me to 'Log this as an issue'."

#### [NEW] [docs/templates/issue_template.md](file:///docs/templates/issue_template.md)
- Create a standard template for reporting issues (Title, Context, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual).

### [Knowledge Graph]

#### [MODIFY] [docs/knowledge/workflows.md](file:///docs/knowledge/workflows.md)
- Update the "Governance Lifecycle" section to include the Web UI issue creation path (referencing `discovered_issues.md`).
- Ensure `Guardrail #31` reference remains accurate.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Review the new instructions in both files.
- Simulate a "Web UI User" flow: Ask Claude to "Log this issue", verify it uses the new template format.
