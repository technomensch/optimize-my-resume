# v8.3.0 - Quality Gates Module Extraction

Extract the Quality Gates, System Guardrails, and Quality Assurance rules into a standalone module to reduce the context size of the GUI entry point.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change involves moving approximately 800 lines of system logic out of the GUI entry point and replacing them with a single reference. This is a continuation of the v8.x modularization strategy.
> 
> **STRICT REQUIREMENT:** Do NOT delete the feature branch after merging; it must remain archived on origin.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Quality Gates & Guardrails

Summary of what will change in this component, separated by files.

#### [NEW] [quality-gates-guardrails.md](optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/quality-gates-guardrails.md)
- Create new module containing the full `<quality_assurance_rules>` block from the Gold Master.
- Include all 29 system guardrails, automatic quality gates, and plain text export logic.

#### [MODIFY] [PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md](PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Add "Silent Sync" HTML comments around the `<quality_assurance_rules>` section (lines 2908-3678).
- `<!-- SILENT SYNC: Quality Gates & Guardrails -->`
- `<!-- END SILENT SYNC: Quality Gates & Guardrails -->`

#### [MODIFY] [Project-GUI-Instructions.md](Project-GUI-Instructions.md)
- Replace the redundant `<quality_assurance_rules>` section (lines 1259-2029) with an active modular reference:
- `<modular_reference file="optimization-tools/resume-analyzer/quality-gates-guardrails.md" />`
- **Cleanup**: Remove redundant separators and empty headers left over from previous extractions (e.g., around lines 1182-1186 and 1200-1204).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification
- Verify that the content in `quality-gates-guardrails.md` is bit-for-bit identical to the section in `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Confirm line count reduction in `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`.

### Manual Verification
- Review the "Silent Sync" placement in `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Review the "Active Reference" in `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`.
- Verify that redundant headers (lines 1182-1186, 1200-1204) have been removed from `Project-GUI-Instructions.md`.
