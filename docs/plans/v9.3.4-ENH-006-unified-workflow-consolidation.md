# Implementation Plan: Unified Multi-Agent Workflow System (ENH-006)

**Version:** v9.3.4
**Issue:** ENH-006
**Branch:** `v9.3.4-ENH-006-unified-workflow-consolidation`
**GitHub Title:** `[ENHANCEMENT] Establish Unified Multi-Agent Workflow System`

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This plan establishes a Single Source of Truth for all AI workflows by symlinking Claude's skills to the Agent's workflow directory. It enforces new governance naming policies to prevent logic drift across multiple agent interfaces.

## 2. Pre-Flight Checks (DELEGATES to /git-governance)
- [x] Create feature branch: `v9.3.4-ENH-006-unified-workflow-consolidation`
- [ ] Verify parent branch (v9.3.3) is committed.
- [ ] Create draft PR (Closes ENH-006).

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### 3.1: Asset Backup & Preparation
- [ ] `mkdir -p .claude/skills_backup`
- [ ] `cp .claude/skills/*.md .claude/skills_backup/`

### 3.2: Surgical Merges (The "Authoritative" Fold)
- [ ] **Merge `start-issue-tracking.md`**: base from Agent, inject Claude templates.
- [ ] **Promote `lesson-learned.md`**: copy Claude's v1.3 to `.agent/workflows/`.
- [ ] **Promote `session-summary.md`**: copy Claude version to `.agent/workflows/`.

### 3.3: Migration
- [ ] Move `.claude/skills/enforce-shadow-sync.md` → `.agent/workflows/`.
- [ ] Move `.claude/skills/update-knowledge-graph.md` → `.agent/workflows/`.

### 3.4: The SymLink Bridge
- [ ] `rm -rf .claude/skills`
- [ ] `ln -s ../.agent/workflows .claude/skills`

### 3.5: Instruction & Metrics Update
- [ ] Update `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` with "Unified Workflow System" section.
- [ ] Update `job-history/job_history_summaries_v12.txt` with v12.0 accomplishments.
- [ ] Convert `job_history_summaries_v12.txt` to `.md`.

## 4. Verification Plan
- [ ] Run `ls -la .claude/skills` to check link.
- [ ] Verify skill visibility in both Gemini and Claude CLI.
- [ ] Execute `/enforce-shadow-sync` to check internal logic consistency.
