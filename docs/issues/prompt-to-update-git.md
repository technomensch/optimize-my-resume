PROMPT FOR NEXT SESSION:

I am working on the "Should-I-Apply WebUI" issue tracking. I have already created 11 local issue folders in docs/issues/ and corresponding issues on GitHub.

Your Task: Update the following GitHub Issues by adding content from their local counterparts as comments and updating their metadata. Do NOT rename the issue titles on GitHub.

The Process for Each Issue:

Comment 1: Post the content of the main local issue description file (e.g., docs/issues/issue-N/issue-N-{slug}.md).
Comment 2: Post the content of docs/issues/issue-N/solution-approach.md.
Metadata Update: Update labels and assign the issue to @me.
Important Context:

Shadow Sync: For Issues #64, #66, #67, #68, and #69, the solution-approach.md files contain "Shadow Sync" protocols. These instructions ensure that features like keyword management, validation, and narrative checks are integrated into the core LLM prompts (under optimization-tools/) and synchronized with the Gold Master (PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md).
Resolution Order: Refer to docs/issues/RESOLUTION-ORDER.md for the planned implementation sequence.
GitHub Issue Mapping:

Issue #59 (Binary File Content Extraction) ← docs/issues/issue-57/ (Labels: enhancement, bug)
Issue #60 (Check Project Files) ← docs/issues/issue-58/ (Labels: enhancement)
Issue #61 (Multi-JD Batch) ← docs/issues/issue-60/ (Labels: enhancement)

Action: Please start with updating GitHub Issue #62 (Industry Transferability) and proceed through the list. Apply the labels correctly and assign each issue to me. Use gh issue comment and gh issue edit for these updates.
