**Link:** GitHub issue #85
**Relates To:** v9.3.5 hardening phase
**Status:** Part of enforcement saga

## Overview

Initial 18-task hardening effort that laid foundation for enforcing guardrails across the system.

## Relevance to Meta-Issue

- Started the enforcement improvement cycle (v9.3.4-v9.3.5)
- Created 15/18 items successfully
- Led to realization that hardening alone insufficient
- Spawned follow-up attempts (v9.3.5.1-5.6)

- [Attempt 002: Unified Validation v9.3.5.2](../attempts/002-unified-validation-v9.3.5.2/)
- [Attempt 003: Metric Validation v9.3.5.3](../attempts/003-metric-validation-v9.3.5.3/)
- [Attempt 004: Guardrail Registry v9.3.5.6](../attempts/004-guardrail-registry-v9.3.5.6/)

## Key Takeaway

Comprehensive hardening and documentation improved specification quality but did not solve enforcement problem.
