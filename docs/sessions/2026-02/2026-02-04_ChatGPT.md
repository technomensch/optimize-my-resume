# Session: Resume Guardrails, Documentation Infrastructure, and Codex Integration

**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Type:** Planning  
**Duration:** ~3.5 hours  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on designing, freezing, and validating a governed resume system treated as documentation infrastructure rather than prose. The work established a 37-guardrail framework, produced a finalized resume artifact, and aligned local tooling (Codex, knowledge graph, guardrails registry) to prevent drift, authority inflation, and pink-elephant regressions.

---

## What We Built

- A frozen, guardrail-compliant resume for a Documentation and Knowledge Lead role
- A 5-plane guardrail taxonomy governing identity, authority, system design, language hygiene, and change control
- A finalized single-paragraph professional summary with strict punctuation and structure constraints
- A clean separation of Security Operations roles into distinct Program Analyst and Team Lead positions
- An operational model distinguishing ChatGPT (control plane) and Codex (data plane)
- A reusable `/session-summary` skill concept for capturing session context

## Decisions Made

1. **Freeze the guardrail system at 37 rules**  
   Rationale: Prevent drift, reinterpretation, and incremental erosion of constraints once the system reached completeness.

2. **Adopt a 5-plane guardrail taxonomy**  
   Rationale: Scale guardrails without conflict by separating identity, authority, system design, language hygiene, and change control.

3. **Treat the resume as a governed artifact, not a narrative document**  
   Rationale: Ensure documentation is evaluated as infrastructure with ownership, lifecycle, and quality controls.

4. **Separate Security Operations Program Analyst and Team Lead into two positions**  
   Rationale: Remove authority ambiguity and reinforce one-axis-of-ownership per role.

5. **Define ChatGPT as control plane and Codex as data plane**  
   Rationale: Prevent Codex’s action bias from mutating frozen artifacts without explicit approval.

6. **Persist only decisions and finalized artifacts, not raw chat transcripts**  
   Rationale: Avoid knowledge graph pollution and preserve monotonic state.

## Problems Solved

- **Resume drift and authority inflation**  
  → Solved by freezing guardrails and enforcing explicit ownership boundaries.

- **Pink elephant reintroduction through iterative edits**  
  → Solved by adding meta-guardrails and a change-control plane.

- **Ambiguity between writing, product, and systems roles**  
  → Solved by reframing documentation as infrastructure and clarifying negative capabilities.

- **Unclear handoff between ChatGPT and Codex**  
  → Solved by defining tool roles and a read-only analysis-first workflow.
