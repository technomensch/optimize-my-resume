### Memory Systems

**Category:** Concept
**Tags:** #architecture #memory #knowledge-management

#### Quick Summary

The optimize-my-resume project uses a four-pillar memory system to capture and retrieve knowledge across Claude Code sessions.

#### Details

**Four Pillars:**
1. **Lessons Learned** - Detailed problem-solving journeys categorized by type
2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Formal decision documentation
3. **Knowledge Graph** - Quick-reference concepts, patterns, and gotchas
4. **Session Summaries** - Auto-documented work context

#### Common Use Cases

- Finding solutions to previously-solved problems
- Understanding why decisions were made
- Quick reference during active development
- Onboarding new contributors

#### Cross-References

- **ADR:** [005-memory-system-architecture.md](../decisions/005-memory-system-architecture.md) (to be created)
- **Sessions:** [2026-01/2026-01-02_memory-system-design.md](../sessions/2026-01/2026-01-02_memory-system-design.md) (to be created)
- **Related:** [[patterns.md#knowledge-organization]]
