## Valid Metric Types

### Measurable Results
- **Dollar amounts:** $500K, $2.3M, $15M
- **Percentages:** increased by 25%, 98% satisfaction, reduced 30%
- **Multipliers:** 3x growth, 10x improvement
- **Specific numbers:** managed 15 people, 200 clients, 40 runbooks

### Impact Statements
Statements that show business value:
- Revenue generation
- Cost savings
- Efficiency improvements
- Quality enhancements
- Risk reduction
- Customer satisfaction improvements

## Time-Based Statements (Optional)

**Status:** Enhancement, not requirement  
**Purpose:** Adds urgency and context to achievements, makes bullets more dynamic  

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Include sparingly (1-2 per resume is sufficient)
- Best used for exceptional achievements completed faster than expected
- Avoid forcing time elements where they don't add value

**Quality examples:**
- "within 6 months"
- "3 months ahead of schedule"
- "in first quarter"

**NOT required** in every position or section.

## Metric Distribution Philosophy

**NOT every bullet needs a metric.** Quality over quantity.

1. **Target:** 1-2 metrics per position is sufficient (though Position 1 mandates 2)
2. **Purpose:** Metrics should highlight your BEST quantifiable achievements
3. **Balance:** Mix of:
   - Bullets WITH metrics (1-2 per job)
   - Bullets WITHOUT metrics but with strong action verbs and clear impact
   - Bullets that demonstrate scope, responsibility, or skills

**Good Example (3-bullet position):**
```
• Led cross-functional team to deliver MVP 3 months ahead of schedule, earning management recognition  ← HAS METRIC
• Facilitated Agile sprint ceremonies with stakeholders to align requirements and prioritize features  ← NO METRIC (action/scope)
• Designed comprehensive test cases ensuring deployment met acceptance criteria  ← NO METRIC (skill demonstration)
```

**Bad Example (forcing metrics everywhere):**
```
• Led <<X>>-person team for <<Y>> months to deliver MVP <<Z>> weeks ahead of schedule  ← TOO MANY PLACEHOLDERS
• Facilitated <<XX>> sprint ceremonies with <<YY>> stakeholders  ← FORCED/UNNATURAL
• Designed <<ZZ>> test cases covering <<WW>>% of requirements  ← EXCESSIVE
```

**Key Principle:** If a metric doesn't naturally exist or significantly strengthen the bullet, don't force one. Strong action verbs with clear context are often more impactful than fabricated or placeholder-heavy metrics.
