{"body":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe current v6.5.2 instructions produce dramatically different fit assessments depending on which AI model interprets them. For the **same candidate profile and JD**, we observe:\n\n- **Claude (strict interpretation):** 65-70% fit → \"POOR MATCH - Skip this role\"\n- **Gemini (strategic interpretation):** 90-95% fit → \"EXCELLENT FIT - Apply immediately\"\n\nThis discrepancy stems from three rigid guardrails that **mechanically apply penalties** without accounting for **strategic competitive advantages** (rare skills, critical requirements, portfolio projects solving exact gaps).\n\n**Test Case:** Netomi Technical Writer role requiring Git-based workflow\n- Candidate has Git experience via portfolio project (Position 0)\n- Git workflow is RARE skill (<10-20% of TW candidates have it)\n- Current rules penalize portfolio work at 50% and apply -20 to -30 industry penalty\n- Result: Candidate self-rejects from a role they're **genuinely competitive for**\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Guardrail 1: Portfolio Project Weighting (v6.4.0)\n\n**Problem:** This rule doesn't distinguish between:\n- Portfolio project demonstrating RARE, explicitly-required skill (e.g., Git workflow)\n- Portfolio project demonstrating COMMON skill that 80% of candidates have\n\n**Impact:** Candidate with rare skill gets penalized same as candidate with common skill.\n\n### Guardrail 2: Industry Context Validation (v6.4.0)\n\n**Problem:** This penalty applies uniformly to ALL skills/experience, including:\n- Technical skills that are 100% transferable (Git, Python, Markdown, CI/CD)\n- Domain knowledge that has LOW transferability (regulatory compliance, federal processes)\n\n**Impact:** Penalizes transferable technical skills same as non-transferable domain knowledge.\n\n### Guardrail 3: Role Type Experience Validation (v6.4.0)\n\n**Problem:** Strict focus on JOB TITLES rather than ACTUAL DELIVERABLES. Candidate with:\n- 5 months \"Technical Writer\" title\n- 3 years of documentation deliverables (runbooks, CONOPS, guides) as \"Business Analyst\"\n\nGets scored as ~1.5 years TW experience instead of ~3+ years.\n\n**Impact:** Undervalues candidates who did TW work under different titles (common in government contracting).\n\n## Expert Consensus (External Validation)\n\n### Hiring Manager A (50+ TW hires in SaaS):\n> \"Gemini's 'strategic + rare-skill override' methodology is vastly superior for someone who is actually trying to get a job in today's market. Claude's ultra-strict, literal guardrail approach is the one that will cause you to self-reject from roles you would realistically get interviews (and offers) for.\"\n\n**Key insight:** \"Git-based workflow is in the top 3 hardest technical-writer requirements to fill right now. Companies will overlook years of experience and industry gaps for it.\"\n\n### Hiring Manager B:\n> \"Real hiring managers scan for: Deal-breakers, Differentiators, Potential. We DON'T mechanically deduct points for every gap. We look for reasons to say YES, not catalog reasons to say NO.\"\n\n### Hiring Manager C:\n> \"The 'Poor Match' response was doing exactly what a rigid rule-follower should do. The 'Excellent' response required the AI to 'think like a human recruiter' and see that your Portfolio Project was actually better than 3 years of traditional experience.\"\n\n## Recommended Fixes (5-Part Approach)\n\n### Fix 1: Add Strategic Rare Skill Override\n**Purpose:** Allow portfolio projects to override standard penalties when demonstrating rare, critical skills.\n**Location:** Add to <phase_3_pre_generation_assessment> section BEFORE standard scoring.\n**Description:** Allow portfolio projects to override standard penalties when demonstrating rare, critical skills. Runs BEFORE standard scoring.\n\n\n\n```\nxml\n<strategic_rare_skill_override>\n  <priority>CRITICAL</priority>\n  <execution_order>Run BEFORE standard penalty application</execution_order>\n  \n  <step_1_identify_differentiator_skills>\n    <description>Scan JD for skills that create competitive advantage</description>\n    <criteria>\n      A skill qualifies as a \"differentiator\" if it meets ALL of:\n      1.
