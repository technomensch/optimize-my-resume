<professional_summary>
  AI Prompt Engineer and Technical Documentation Specialist developing sophisticated multi-agent
  resume optimization systems using advanced prompt engineering, context engineering, and docs-as-code
  methodologies. Built comprehensive workflow automation system achieving 11 minor version releases
  (v6.0.0 → v6.1.11) in 2 months with 37 commits, 35 documentation files, and 7,194 lines of structured
  technical documentation. Demonstrated expertise in XML-structured prompt design, semantic versioning,

<core_responsibilities>
  <responsibility id="1">
    Designed and implemented multi-agent AI system architecture with 8 specialized agents using
    XML-structured prompts (strategically chosen for cross-LLM portability), semantic tagging,

    tracking across 35 markdown files maintaining 7,194 lines of technical documentation
  </responsibility>
  <responsibility id="3">
    Created 3 reusable workflow automation systems (/patch, /doc-update, /lessons-learned)
    following 5-phase process (Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Documentation)
    with mandatory planning documentation before code implementation, directing AI to generate
    optimal data structures and validation logic
  </responsibility>
  <responsibility id="4">
    Implemented automatic quality assurance gates with 3-iteration regeneration loops validating
    output against 5 verb diversity categories, escaped character detection, gerund prevention,

    Engineered context management patterns (isolation, relay, write-once-read-many, selective loading)
    reducing main instruction file token count from 241K to 203K (16% reduction) while maintaining
    comprehensive system capabilities across Phase 1-4 workflows
  </responsibility>
  <responsibility id="6">
    Created comprehensive knowledge management system in Notion for job hunting optimization and
    technical blog series "Adventures in vibe-coding & docs-as-code" sharing lessons learned on
    LinkedIn, documenting AI-assisted development methodologies for public thought leadership

    advanced AI prompt engineering, context engineering, and docs-as-code capabilities for portfolio
  </project_goal>
  <methodology>
    Multi-LLM AI-driven development workflow: Natural language prompts in markdown → AI generates
    implementation plans → AI generates XML structures (directed by human for cross-platform portability)
    → Human implements according to plan → AI generates reusable prompts for reproducibility →
    Version control with semantic versioning and CHANGELOG tracking across Claude (Sonnet/Haiku/Opus)
    and Gemini platforms
  </methodology>
  <strategic_decisions>

    - Used multi-LLM approach (Claude variants + Gemini) to validate cross-platform compatibility
    - Directed AI to generate optimal data structures rather than manual authoring for efficiency
    - Integrated multiple development tools (VS Code, Antigravity, Claude Code, GitHub, Notion) for comprehensive workflow
    - Created public-facing blog series on LinkedIn to establish thought leadership in AI-assisted development
    - Built Notion-based knowledge management system to systematize job hunting and capture lessons learned
  </strategic_decisions>
  <key_innovations>
    - Automatic quality gates with regeneration loops (max 3 iterations)
    - Keyword evidence principle preventing fabricated content
    - Multi-phase routing with intent detection and JD validation
    - Context engineering patterns (isolation, relay, write-once-read-many, selective loading)
    - Incremental job history updates without full re-analysis
    - Diff-based re-comparison with score delta and improvement/regression tracking
    - Cross-LLM compatibility through strategic XML adoption
    - Notion-based knowledge management system for job hunting tracking with separate lessons learned blog
    - Public thought leadership through LinkedIn blog series on AI-assisted development methodologies
  </key_innovations>
  <future_plans>
    Considering open-sourcing the project to contribute reusable prompt engineering patterns and
    docs-as-code workflows to the AI development community
  </future_plans>
